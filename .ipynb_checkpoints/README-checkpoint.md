# Applied Data Science Capstone course

This repo contains all files and folders for the course of [Applied Data Science Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone?) provided by IBM on Coursera. This course aims to brush up and implement all courses prior to it.

The course is about to utilise Foursquare API to gather data and to implement clustering algorithm to segment such data. There are three kinds of analysis used in this repo, i.e.:
1. [New York neighbourhoods](3-Neighborhoods-New-York.ipynb)
2. [Toronto neighbourhoods](4-Toronto.ipynb)
3. [Sydney and London comparions](FinalAssignment-Week1.md)
